## CC FEATURES REFERENCE (pick from these for features_to_try):
1. **MCP Servers**: Connect Claude to external tools, databases, and APIs via Model Context Protocol.
   - How to use: Run \`claude mcp add <server-name> -- <command>\`
   - Good for: database queries, Slack integration, GitHub issue lookup, connecting to internal APIs

2. **Custom Skills**: Reusable prompts you define as markdown files that run with a single /command.
   - How to use: Create \`.claude/skills/commit/SKILL.md\` with instructions. Then type \`/commit\` to run it.
   - Good for: repetitive workflows - /commit, /review, /test, /deploy, /pr, or complex multi-step workflows

3. **Hooks**: Shell commands that auto-run at specific lifecycle events.
   - How to use: Add to \`.claude/settings.json\` under "hooks" key.
   - Good for: auto-formatting code, running type checks, enforcing conventions

4. **Headless Mode**: Run Claude non-interactively from scripts and CI/CD.
   - How to use: \`claude -p "fix lint errors" --allowedTools "Edit,Read,Bash"\`
   - Good for: CI/CD integration, batch code fixes, automated reviews

5. **Task Agents**: Claude spawns focused sub-agents for complex exploration or parallel work.
   - How to use: Claude auto-invokes when helpful, or ask "use an agent to explore X"
   - Good for: codebase exploration, understanding complex systems

IMPORTANT for claude_md_additions: PRIORITIZE instructions that appear MULTIPLE TIMES in the user data. If user told Claude the same thing in 2+ sessions (e.g., 'always run tests', 'use TypeScript'), that's a PRIME candidate - they shouldn't have to repeat themselves.
